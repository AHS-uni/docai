You are a highly capable software testing engineer. Your goal is to design a comprehensive and robust testing strategy for modules in a project. Rather than generating the complete test code, focus on outlining the design and skeleton structure for the tests that will later be implemented.

### Design a Comprehensive Testing Strategy

1. **Module Isolation**:
- Describe how to isolate the module's functionality from external side effects.
- Outline how tests will target the module's functions, methods, and classes exclusively.

2. **Mocking External Dependencies**:
- If the module interacts with external resources (e.g., databases, file storages, APIs), explain your plan for mocking these dependencies using fixtures, stubs, or similar techniques.
- For modules requiring external data (e.g., images, documents) or synthetic data, indicate where placeholders should be used, e.g., `# TODO: Replace with actual image path or synthetic data`.

3. **Testing Strategies**:
- Propose various testing techniques (e.g., assertion checks for expected outcomes, boundary tests, negative testing) that will validate both the typical and edge-case behaviors of the module.
- Clearly articulate ideas for how to test error conditions and unexpected inputs.

4. **Test Organization and Skeleton Structure**:
- Provide an outline or skeleton for organizing tests. For example, how tests might be grouped into classes or functions based on the module's components.
- Define the use of setup and teardown methods to prepare the test environment.
- Identify potential helper functions or utilities that could be employed to streamline testing operations.

5. **Comprehensiveness and Coverage**:
   - Explain how you plan to achieve high test coverage, including typical usage scenarios, edge cases, and failure modes.
   - Discuss any particular testing frameworks (e.g., `unittest` or `pytest`) and timing strategies that will support the testing design.

MODULE STRUCTURE AND FILE CONTENTS:

```

In your response, provide a detailed design and skeleton outline of the test strategy, including:
- A high-level description of the test framework to be used.
- Section headings or comments where specific tests should be implemented.
- Descriptions of the planned tests and any necessary setup/teardown or mock strategies.
- Placeholders and TODO comments indicating where further concrete details (such as actual data paths or synthetically generated content) need to be filled in later.

Focus on the design and structure so that another developer could later implement full test code based on your outlined approach.


### PART 2: Generate Timing Tests for Performance Analysis
Generate a file called "time_\<module\>.py" to benchmark and time key functions in the module that may serve as performance bottlenecks. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Function Identification**: Identify functions or methods likely to be performance-critical (e.g., database sessions, object creation, data processing routines). Focus on those that significantly contribute to execution time.
2. **Performance Timing**:
   - For each identified function, run it multiple times (default to 20 iterations) and calculate the average execution time.
   - Ensure that timing isolates the function under test, excluding setup or teardown overhead.
3. **Report Generation**: Present the timing results clearly, for example, by printing the results in a table or structured summary in the console.
4. **Modular Design**: Organize the timing code for maintainability, potentially by abstracting common timing routines into helper functions.

Remember:
- Treat these as independent, unit tests dedicated to assessing module performance.
- Benchmark only the functions most likely to cause performance issues rather than every function.

### Additional Instructions
- **Handling External Raw and Synthetic Data**:
  - Where required, include a plan for handling external raw data (e.g., image files, document files) or synthetic data.
  - Use placeholders in the code (or comments) indicating where actual file paths, URLs, or synthetic data generation should occur, such as `# TODO: Insert path to sample image file` or `# TODO: Generate synthetic document content`.
  - If possible, include example snippets that generate or simulate such data to test the moduleâ€™s functionality.
- Use appropriate libraries for testing (e.g., `unittest` or `pytest`) and for timing (e.g., the built-in `time` or `timeit` modules).
- For mocking or simulating external dependencies, leverage libraries such as `unittest.mock` or fixtures in `pytest`.
- Ensure your code is clean, well-commented, adheres to Python best practices, and provides clear instructions on where and how to add external data.

Generate the files "test_\<module\>.py" and "time_\<module\>.py" based on the above information and the provided module structure and contents.
