You are a highly capable software-testing engineer. Your goal is to design a comprehensive, end-to-end testing strategy for an entire Python package (not just a single module). This package is part of a distributed RAG system and makes heavy use of asynchronous calls and a server–client architecture. Rather than writing full test code, focus on outlining the design and skeleton structure for the tests that will later be implemented.

### Design a Comprehensive Testing Strategy for the Package

1. **High-Level Test Framework**
- State which framework(s) you’d use (e.g. `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio` plugins, or `unittest` with `asyncio` support).
- Describe how you’ll configure the test runner (e.g. `pytest.ini`) to discover tests across multiple subpackages.

2. **Module/Flow Isolation**
- Explain how you’ll split tests into separate files or folders, each targeting:
- Core async services (e.g. ingestion, retrieval, storage)
- Client interfaces (e.g. HTTP client stubs, message-queue clients)
- Server endpoints (e.g. FastAPI/Starlette routes, request handlers)
- For each section, describe how to isolate side effects (e.g. `pytest` fixtures that spin up in-memory servers or mock message brokers).

3. **Mocking & Stubbing External Dependencies**
- For database calls, file I/O, or external APIs, outline use of:
- `pytest-mock` or `unittest.mock.AsyncMock` for async stubs
- Fixtures that provide fake data or in-memory stand-ins (e.g. SQLite in memory, a fake S3 server)
- Show where to place TODO comments for real file paths or synthetic data (e.g. `# TODO: provide sample PDF bytes here`).

4. **Testing Async Flows & Server–Client Interactions**
- Describe how to:
- Use `pytest.mark.asyncio` (or equivalent) to test `async def` functions.
- Spin up a test instance of the server (e.g. via `TestClient` from FastAPI) to send real HTTP requests.
- Verify full request→response cycles, including error codes, headers, and payloads.
- Outline how to simulate concurrent requests, timeouts, and graceful failure modes.

5. **Test Organization & Skeleton Structure**
- Provide a directory sketch, for example:
     ```
     tests/
       conftest.py
       integration/
         test_server_endpoints.py
         test_client_integration.py
       unit/
         test_async_services.py
         test_helpers.py
         test_schemas.py
     ```
     - Show in each file:
     ```python
     import pytest
     from mypackage.module import SomeService

     @pytest.fixture
     async def service():
         # TODO: set up fake dependencies
         return SomeService(...)

     @pytest.mark.asyncio
     async def test_some_method_success(service):
         # Arrange
         # TODO: prepare input
         # Act
         result = await service.some_method(...)
         # Assert
         assert result == ...
     ```

6. **Setup & Teardown**
- Explain use of session-scoped fixtures for heavy resources (e.g. a test database).
- Show per-test fixtures for clean state (e.g. resetting in-memory queues).

7. **Coverage & Robustness**
- Describe how to ensure:
- Coverage of happy paths, edge cases, and failure modes.
- Test of retry logic, circuit breakers, backoff strategies.
- Propose using coverage tools (e.g. `pytest-cov`) and test thresholds.

8. **Placeholders & TODOs**
- In the skeletons, include:
     ```python
     # TODO: insert path to sample image file
     # TODO: generate synthetic document bytes
     ```
     - Mark where to add real message-broker URLs or credentials for integration tests.

In your response, deliver a detailed outline—complete with section headings, example skeletons, fixture descriptions, and mock strategies—so that another developer can immediately begin implementing full test code against your package.
